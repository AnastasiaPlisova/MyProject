First of all my script merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

Then exracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Then rename the activity labels to use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Then appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names according to features.
Evaluate new data set with the means of each variable for each activity and each subject.
